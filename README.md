# Waluigi
Waluigi is now in super smash bors melee
Use dolphin emulator to run the ROM

We made this by:
1) replacing Mario’s character model with the model of Waluigi from mario tennis.

Source -> https://modulous.net/mod/1740/Waluigi%20(Over%20Mario)

2) We changed the texture of the skins using Dat Texture wizard.

2) We replaced the textures of Mario’s fireball, cap, and other icons with a tennis ball, tennis racket, and Waluigi’s.

3) We replaced the audio files with Waluigi Pinball.

4) We modified the .dat files with a hex editor to fix some model issues.
