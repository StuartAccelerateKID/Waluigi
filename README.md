# Waluigi
Waluigi is now in super smash bors melee
Use dolphin emulator to run the ROM

We made this by:
1) replacing Mario’s character model with the model of Waluigi from mario tennis.

2) We replaced the textures of Mario’s fireball, cap, and other icons with a tennis ball, tennis racket, and Waluigi’s.

3) We replaced the audio files with our own recorded Waluigi imitations.

4) We modified the .dat files with a hex editor to fix some model issues.

5) We are working on customizing moves.
